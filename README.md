Original README


Elevator Saga
===================
The elevator programming game

[Play it now!](http://play.elevatorsaga.com/)

Or [Run the unit tests](http://play.elevatorsaga.com/test/)

For developers/contributors: This project is not actively maintained. The repo is used to serve github pages so I would like to keep it as is. Feel free to fork and host your own versions of Elevator Saga! But I would like to keep the domain name with the original version of the game.
